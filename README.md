* Modes:
    * Sync - Render lyrics and synchronize them in real time with an HTML `<audio>` element.

    * Print - Render lyrics from `.lrc` files without syncing.

    * Extract - Parse .lrc files to get structured lyric, timing, and metadata data.

* Animations - Two styles: `normal` (static) and `slide`. Optional auto-scroll, wheel/touch scroll handling, and click-to-seek.

* Full-control - Start, pause, next, previous, go to a specific lyric/time, retrieve current lyric info in real-time.

* Search - Find a lyric by time or find the timestamp(s) for a given lyric.

| actKaraoke | boolean | isKaraoke's value | Whether to actively display karaoke segment |

## Animations

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| animation_type | string | "normal" | "normal" or "slide" |  
| auto_scroll | boolean | false | Automatically scroll to the active lyric (only in "slide") |
| wheel_scroll | boolean | true | Enable mouse-wheel scrolling within sync scroll constraints (only in "slide") |
| touch_scroll | boolean | true | Enable touch scrolling within sync scroll constraints (only in "slide") |

| keyframe_id | string | "LyricaLyricIn" | The name of a CSS keyframe animation that will be applied only when a lyric becomes active in "normal" mode. |

## CSS Classes
* Each lyric line is rendered inside an element with the class `.lyric` (applies to both normal and slide modes).
* Active state:
    * In slide mode: the current line or current word (in karaoke) receives the `.active` class.
    * In normal mode: only the current word receives the `.active` class.
* Passed lines: any line that has already been played is marked with the `.passed` class. (only in "slide")
* Tag types:
    * By default (no karaoke), each line is a `<p>` element in both normal and slide modes.
    * When `isKaraoke: true` and `actKaraoke: true`, each word inside the line is wrapped in a `<span>` for fine-grained karaoke highlighting.
* In `karaoke + actKaraoke`, the line itself still has the `.lyric` class, but instead of plain text, its words are split into `<span>`s so timing can highlight each word individually.
